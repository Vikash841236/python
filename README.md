# Data Analysis of Myntra Products: Optimizing Pricing and Discount Strategies

### **Project Overview**

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of products from Myntra, an online ecommerce store, to derive meaningful insights and visualize them effectively. The primary goal is to optimize Myntra's pricing and discount strategies to increase sales, enhance customer satisfaction, and maintain profitability.

### **Problem Statement**

Myntra aims to balance competitive pricing with attractive discounts across diverse product categories. The challenge is to identify optimal pricing segments and understand customer preferences to refine pricing and promotional strategies.

### **Objectives**
1. Analyze the distribution of product prices and ratings.
2. Identify high-performing products and top sellers.
3. Examine the impact of pricing and discounts on customer ratings.
4. Provide actionable recommendations for pricing and discount strategies.

### **Technologies Used**
- Excel: For initial data understanding and basic data cleaning (although the large dataset required transitioning to Python for efficiency).
- Python: Data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization
- Power BI: Dashboard creation and data presentation

### **Data Cleaning Steps**
- Dropping unnecessary columns: Removed 'img', 'asin', and 'purl' columns.
- Checking for missing values: Ensured no missing values in the dataset.
- Checking for duplicates: Removed any duplicate entries.
- Creating new columns: Added 'totalDiscount' and 'percentageDiscount' columns to analyze discounts.

### **Key Analysis Points**
